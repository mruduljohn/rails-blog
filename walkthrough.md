 

Step 1: User opens the website.
In this step, the user has opened the website by visiting the root URL (/) or any other URL that leads to the home page.

Expected outcome: The home page is displayed to the user.

Step 2: User makes two identical requests to the server.
In this step, the user made two consecutive GET requests to the same resource (root URL). This might be due to some kind of caching issue or browser behavior.

Expected outcome: The server responds with the same content for both requests.

Step 3: User requests an article with ID 3.
In this step, the user made a GET request to retrieve an article with the ID 3 from the server.

Expected outcome: The server returns the requested article with the ID 3 in the response.

Step 4: User requests another article with ID 1.
In this step, the user made a GET request to retrieve an article with the ID 1 from the server.

Expected outcome: The server returns the requested article with the ID 1 in the response.By analyzing these activities, we can infer that the user was exploring the website's content and accessing specific articles through their interactions with the system. A possible explanation for the duplicate requests could be related to browser caching or session management. Further investigation would be required to determine the exact cause.
